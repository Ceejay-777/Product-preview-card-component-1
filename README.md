## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid


### What I learned

- I've learnt the exact use of the viewport metatag. I hd been using it without understanding it before now.

- Having serious issues getting the images to change according to screen width. 
```html
	<picture></picture>
```
  The picture tag isn't working as expected.

- I have finally opted for just the 
```html 
<img></img> 
``` 
tags and using media queries.

- After a few hours of needless work, I think I have finally mastered google fonts and fontawesome, and the shouldn't give me issues on further projects.

- Yay! I've used grid layout for the first time in a project.

### Continued development

- I'll be looking more into screen sizes and responsive website development. Also, I'll invest more time in the analytics of different types of screen sizes.

- I'll look for more opportunities to use grid layout so I can master it.

### Useful resources

- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - A lot of my questions were already asked the way I wanted to ask it and different experienced people had already given their views and methods.
