### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

- I've learnt the exact use of the viewport metatag. I hd been using it without understanding it before now.

- Having serious issues getting the images to change according to screen width. 
```html
	<picture></picture>
```
	The picture tag isn't working as expected.

- I have finally opted for just the 
```html 
<img></img> 
``` 
tags and using media queries.

- After a few hours of needless work, I think I have finally mastered google fonts and fontawesome, and the shouldn't give me issues on further projects.

- Yay! I've used grid layout for the first time in a project.

### Continued development

- I'll be looking more into screen sizes and responsive website development. Also, I'll invest more time in the analytics of different types of screen sizes.

- I'll look for more opportunities to use grid layout so I can master it.

### Useful resources

- [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com) - A lot of my questions were already asked the way I wanted to ask it and different experienced people had already given their views and methods.
